A Tianwen-1 observing campaign was begun to determine if any evidence of a planned aerobrake test could be observed.  Data appears to show the test claimed for late 2022 is not underway and the spacecraft is periodically exhibiting an emission anomaly that is not explainable via standard Doppler analysis techniques and doesn't appear related to rover communication attempts.

Raw STRF data is provided.

MJD, Freq, Sigma(signal intensity), COSPAR site

During this observing session 1s by 100Hz bins are being used to reduce the data management required.  This does result in large residuals but the trends in the data are clear and this doesn't effect the nature of this investigation.  Primarily period measurements are being performed on Doppler reversals and noting the anomalies are not effected.
